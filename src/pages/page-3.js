            keep track of how many people are currenty infected with the virus 
            (worldwide).This website was implemented in Gatsbyjs, React, as well as 
            Chartjs.

        <h2>How is COVID-19 spread?</h2>
        <p>You can become infected by coming into close
            contact (about 6 feet or two arm lengths) with a person
            who has COVID-19. COVID-19 is primarily spread from person
            to person. You can become infected from respiratory droplets
            when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.
            You may also be able to get it by touching a surface
            or object that has the virus on it, and then by touching by
            your mouth, nose, or eyes.
